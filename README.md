Final Project (collaboration with Dev Academy Group)

The idea of the app is to create a site for Earth Friendly Events, to post their events so people can join them, and to view the events as a user (MVP version)

## The Tech

* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/docs/react/overview)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
* [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/)
* [Auth0](https://www.auth0.com)

## User Stories

### MVP

As a non-registered user, I want to:

* Register for the App under my name
* Browse a list of all the events posted by other users
* Click into an event and view the details
* View the events ordered by date

As a registered user, I want to:

* Create an event
* Be able to edit or delete an event I've created
* Be able to join an event 
* Be able to view my joined events in the 'myevents' page

### Stretch

As both a registered and non-registered user
* Filter events by location

As a registered user:
* I want to save reviews to the 'myevents' component so I can remember my events too!
* As a user I want to save my event and view them on the 'myevents'
* Badges for users per events attended (every time you go to an event you get 'points' added to your profile, level up)
* Community Forum - blog/ reviews page
